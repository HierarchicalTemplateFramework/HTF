# Representational View State Transfer (RVST)

## Introduction
Representational View State Transfer (RVST) is a standard designed to dynamically manage user interfaces through RESTful 
principles, facilitating seamless server-driven view state management across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

## Getting Started
This repository serves as the working draft for the RVST standard. It includes the 
[JSON-Schema for v1](./schemas/rvst.v1.schema.json) and [example implementations](./examples) which you can use as a basis for 
your integration tests.

Detailed setup and integration guides will be provided soon. In the meantime, familiarize yourself with the provided 
schema and examples to start integrating RVST in your projects.

## Key Concepts
RVST combines the robustness of REST with dynamic UI management to reduce frontend development complexity while 
enhancing consistency across different platforms. It ensures that the server drives most, if not all, view states, 
which simplifies client-side logic and maintenance.

For a deeper dive into RVST's principles, see our 
[concepts and principles documentation](/docs/concepts-and-principles.md).
