RVST Documentation Outline
Introduction

    Overview of RVST: Explain what RVST is, its purpose, and how it integrates with HAL.
    Goals and Objectives: Describe the problems RVST aims to solve, particularly how it enhances HAL by specifying views.

Concepts and Terminology

    Basic Concepts: Introduce essential terms and concepts used in RVST, such as "views", "components", and "layout".
    Relationship to HAL: Explain how RVST builds on HAL, including its reliance on _links and _embedded resources.

Getting Started

    Setting Up: Instructions on how to integrate RVST into existing HAL-based systems.
    First Example: Walk through a simple example, such as a single resource with a view, to demonstrate basic RVST usage.

View Specification

    Defining Views: Detailed instructions on how to define views within the _views object.
        Components: Explain what components are, how to define them, and their roles.
        Layouts: Discuss different layouts and how they influence the rendering of components on the client side.
    Linking Views to Data: Guidelines on how to link views to specific parts of the data provided in _embedded sections.
    Parameterization: How to pass parameters to views for customization and flexibility.
    Localization and Internationalization: Best practices for supporting multiple locales within views.

Detailed Examples

    Blog Example: A comprehensive example that shows how to use RVST for a blog application, including multiple types of content such as posts, lists, and dashboards.
    E-commerce Example: Demonstrate a more complex scenario using an e-commerce platform, showing product listings, product details, and carts.

Advanced Topics

    Dynamic vs. Static Views: Discussion on when to use dynamic views and how RVST handles static views.
    Handling Complex Views: Techniques for managing complex views that involve multiple resources or nested views.
    Integration with Client-Side Technologies: Advice on integrating RVST with various client-side frameworks and platforms, noting that specific frameworks like React or Angular are not directly supported.

API Reference

    View Components: List all standard components defined by RVST, their expected inputs, and behaviors.
    Error Handling: Define how errors should be communicated through RVST, even though detailed error management is outside the standardâ€™s scope.
    HTTP Status Codes and Responses: Describe how RVST expects HTTP status codes to be used in conjunction with view rendering.

Best Practices

    Performance Optimization: Tips for optimizing performance when using RVST, particularly concerning client-side rendering.
    Security Considerations: General security considerations developers should keep in mind while implementing RVST, even though security is not directly handled by the standard.

FAQs

    Common Issues: Address common questions or problems developers might encounter when using RVST.

Change Log

    Version History: Provide a history of changes and version updates to the RVST documentation and standard.

Conclusion

Good documentation not only explains how to use the standard but also why certain decisions were made, how it can be extended, and how it interacts with existing systems. This will help developers adopt RVST more easily and effectively integrate it into their projects. Be sure to keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes to the standard and gather feedback from the developer community to continually improve it.
