# RVST: Concepts and Principles

## Introduction
Representational View State Transfer (RVST) is designed to facilitate a seamless integration of dynamic user interface 
management with RESTful architectural principles. This document explores the core concepts and principles that underlie 
RVST, providing a deeper understanding of its design and functionality.

### Core Concepts
1. View State Management

At the heart of RVST is the management of view states across client applications. Unlike traditional approaches that 
embed state management within the client, RVST proposes a server-driven strategy where the server dictates the state of 
the UI components. This approach ensures that the UI on the client side reflects the current state of the system as 
maintained on the server, leading to enhanced consistency and reduced complexity in client-side development.

Key Features:
- **Centralized State Control**: All state logic and management are centralized on the server.
- **Updates**: Clients receive updates when it makes calls back to the backend.
- **Dynamic Updates**: It would be possible to use WebRTC or some other technique to have the server push changes instead of only have updates with pull.

2. RESTful Integration

RVST extends the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) by applying them not just to data resources but 
also to UI components. Each view in RVST is treated as a resource that can be created, read, updated, or deleted through 
standard HTTP methods.

Principles Applied:
- **Stateless Communications**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information the server needs to understand and fulfill the request.
- **Uniform Interface**: Interaction with view states is standardized, using the same REST principles that govern data interactions.
- **Cacheable Responses**: View definitions can be cached as appropriate to improve performance.

3. Dynamic Views

Dynamic views are defined in JSON format and specify how UI components should be rendered, what data they display, and 
how they behave. These views are not static; they can be modified in real time to adapt to changes in the system or 
user inputs.

Implementation:
- **Template and Component Definitions**: Views are described using templates or components that the server sends as responses to client requests.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Views can include logic for conditional rendering based on the state data, user roles, or other criteria.

## Guiding Principles
1. Server-driven UI

The UI is entirely driven by the server, which sends comprehensive view configurations to the client. This reduces the 
burden on client-side logic and enhances the ability to manage and update UIs centrally from the server.

2. Uniformity and Simplicity

RVST promotes uniformity across different platforms (web, mobile, desktop) by using a common set of rules for view 
state management. This simplicity aids developers in understanding and applying the standard without needing to tailor 
UI logic for each platform.

3. Extensibility

While RVST provides a robust framework for managing UIs, it is designed to be extensible. Developers can extend the 
standard views with custom properties and behaviors to meet specific needs without departing from the foundational 
principles.

## Conclusion
RVST offers a novel approach to integrating RESTful principles with dynamic UI management, simplifying the development 
process and enhancing the scalability and maintainability of applications. By understanding these core concepts and 
principles, developers can leverage RVST to build responsive, consistent, and efficient user interfaces.

This document should provide a thorough understanding of RVST's design philosophy and practical implications, making it 
easier for developers to implement and adapt RVST in various application scenarios.
